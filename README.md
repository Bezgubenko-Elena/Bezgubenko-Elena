## Hi there, I'm Helen ðŸ‘‹


Now I'm studying on _Software Testing Courses by Vadim Ksendzov_ and I want to become a manual QA.
I'll show proofs of my testing's skills here.

Also I'm interested in Frontend Programming. I'll do it in parallel with the testing's study.
My immediate plans - to create a website with my resume, and then find those who need a website created by a newbie.

### My skills:
* [SQL](https://github.com/Bezgubenko-Elena/Sql.git)
* [Terminal](https://github.com/Bezgubenko-Elena/Terminal.git)
* Javascript
* Postman
* [DevTools](https://github.com/Bezgubenko-Elena/Devtools.git)
